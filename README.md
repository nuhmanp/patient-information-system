# PatientInformationSystem
This is a project I created as a part of CS 249 - Distributed Computing during Master's in Computer Science.

Description:
A distributed Java application written using Spring Boot that allows hospitals to manage admitted patient information such as health statistics (basic health information) and treatment information (present as well as historical).

The components can be deployed on AWS.
This information can be accessed over REST APIs.

Technologies used:
Java, Spring Boot, ActiveMQ Message Broker, Cassandra DB, REST, HazelCast Caching Framework, Apache Tomcat Server, AWS.
